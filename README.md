`Mandrill` is a Patching Configuration System that provides users with a range of options to customize the patching process for their VM instances.

It allows users to select VM instances manually or by groups, filter VMs based on name or labels, and choose the types of upgrades to perform.

Users can also specify packages to upgrade or exclude, and choose post-patch reboot options. The system also allows users to run pre-patch and post-patch scripts, and set rollout options and schedule types.
